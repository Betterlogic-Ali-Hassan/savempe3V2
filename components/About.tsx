        How It Works?
      </h3>
      <p className='text-lg font-medium'>
        Using our VK, Instagram, and Soundcloud downloader involve a simple,
        three-step process that takes just a moment to complete. <br /> <br />
        Step 1 – Open your favorite video streaming website and copy the URL of
        the video you want to download from your browser’s address bar. Remember
        to select the entire URL and copy it from the contextual menu or
        keyboard shortcut (CTRL +C for Windows or CMD + C on Mac).
        <br />
        <br />
        Step 2 – Go to the Savemp3.net YouTube mp3 downloader website and paste
        the URL into Savemp3’s input field, before clicking on the button to run
        the process.
        <br />
        <br />
        Step 3 – It will take just a few seconds for your mp3 file to be
        processed, after which, all that’s left to do is click on download and
        set a save destination on your phone, laptop, or in cloud storage.
        <br />
        <br />
